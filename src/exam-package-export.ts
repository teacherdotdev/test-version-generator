 * holding exactly its Questions in Exam order (ADR-0036). What travels with an
 * Exam is the Exam's material, not the teacher's banks, so the banks it drew
 * on keep their names and descriptions at home.
 *
 * Only a PDF whose Content Selection includes the answer key carries one — a
 * Question Bank Record holds the answers, so a student-only PDF must not —
 * and a DOCX never does, because a teacher's Word edits would leave it stale.
 * The package is kept on the Export Record beside its Layout Plans rather
 * than in them, so the Export Fingerprint and print/DOCX parity, which are
 * about pages, never see it.
