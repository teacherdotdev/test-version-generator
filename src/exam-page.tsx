// The exam page: what the teacher looks at, and what the printer prints.
//
// This is the print Export Adapter: everything on it comes from the Layout Plan
// `export-plan.ts` returns, so this file only decides what a planned page looks
// like — never what is on it, in what order, or under which number. Nothing
// here is typeable: a double-click opens the question dialog instead, and every
// editing control lives in chrome that print hides.
//
// A page is a real sheet: fixed at the geometry `export-plan.ts` packed
// against, published to CSS as custom properties so the two cannot drift, with
// the furniture — the identity line, the title, the page number — drawn from
// the plan's own `PageFurniture` rather than being content that packs. The DOCX
// adapter prints the same furniture from the same field.
//
// The one asynchronous thing on this page is measurement, and it is the reason
// `pages` is state rather than a value computed during render: see
// `usePaginatedExam`.
