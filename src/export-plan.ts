// Export planning: one Export Document, one Layout Plan.
//
// This is the single module that decides what an exam arrangement *says* and how it
// *falls onto pages*. Both Export Adapters — the React/HTML print path and the
// DOCX writer — consume the Layout Plan it returns. Neither walks an `Exam`
// itself, so a content or pagination rule is implemented and fixed once.
//
// The interface callers and tests use is `planExport`: an exam, one arrangement,
// the requested content selection and a `Measure` in; a complete `LayoutPlan`
// out. The two stages behind it are internal:
//
//   1. Semantic derivation into an `ExportDocument` — sections, continuous
//      question numbering, this arrangement's choice order and the letters it
//      earns, choice-grid topology, the answer key.
//   2. Layout resolution into a `LayoutPlan` — page assignment, page furniture,
//      footer numbering, and the explicit break decisions a serializer needs.
//
// Measurement is injected rather than taken from the DOM, so the whole pipeline
// is testable without a browser: nothing here reads a layout property itself,
// it asks `Measure` for one. Export Adapters never measure and never repaginate.
//
// Packing is atomic by default: a question that fits stays whole, and one that
// does not fit moves to the next page whole. Only a question that alone exceeds
// a full content box is ever split, and then only at the boundaries between its
// top-level stem blocks — never through a choice grid or a matching set, and
// never leaving a bare question number at the foot of a page.
