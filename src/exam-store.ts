// The authoring state and the store that owns it.
//
// The authoring state — the Question Bank, the Working Copy, and the dirty
// flag — is mirrored to a backend on every change, so a refresh loses nothing.
// The backend is a narrow injectable interface: the app hands the store the
// normalized IndexedDB generation, while unit tests use an in-memory backend.
//
// The store is also the one authoring boundary. Every semantic action a teacher
// can take on the Question Bank or the Working Copy is a single method here:
// creating canonical Question Content with or without putting it on the exam,
// adding a reference, editing a banked question's content and metadata, moving
// a reference, arranging Sections, and Removing a reference. Callers never assemble an
// action out of smaller ones — that is what makes each of them atomic, one undo
// step, and one mirrored write.
